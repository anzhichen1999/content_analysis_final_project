# A brief introduction to my content analysis final project


## Research Question
This project aims to investigate the relationship between the tone and frequency of positive foreign event coverage in Chinese party newspapers and the Chinese government's commitment to the Open-Up Policy. The central hypothesis is that an increase in positive depictions of foreign events, particularly those aligning with the principles of the Open-Up Policy, in these state-controlled media sources may signal a governmental inclination towards greater international engagement and economic liberalization. A comparative analysis will be conducted between the Chinese and English editions of the People's Daily to determine if there are noticeable differences in the portrayal of these events.

## Corpus
The primary corpus for this study consists of articles from the People's Daily Newspaper, both in its Chinese and English editions (namingly Chinese version and Foregign Version). The focus will be on content that pertains to foreign events and international relations, especially those that can be linked to China's Open-Up Policy. This corpus will be systematically sampled to cover a significant time frame, ensuring a comprehensive representation of the newspaper's coverage. The data will be prepared for analysis by segmenting and tagging relevant articles and sections, with a particular focus on identifying and categorizing the tone and specific themes related to the Open-Up Policy.

## Methods
1. Utilizing advanced word embedding techniques, such as Word2Vec or GloVe, to analyze semantic relationships and shifts in the portrayal of foreign events over time. This approach will enable a nuanced understanding of how terms related to the Open-Up Policy and positive foreign events are contextually situated within the broader discourse, revealing subtle changes in meanings and associations.

2. Implementing machine learning algorithms to classify articles based on their sentiment and thematic alignment with the Open-Up Policy. This step will involve training classifiers to discern positive, neutral, and negative tones in the coverage of foreign events. Moreover, it will categorize articles according to their relevance to the Open-Up Policy, thereby quantifying the extent to which this policy is reflected in the newspaper's content.

3. Employing deep learning techniques to perform causal inference, understanding the cause-effect relationship between the tone and frequency of positive foreign event coverage and shifts in China's Open-Up Policy. This could involve constructing and training neural network models that can predict changes in policy orientation based on trends observed in the newspaper coverage. This approach aims to establish a more concrete link between media representation and policy direction, transcending mere correlation to suggest potential causal pathways.
